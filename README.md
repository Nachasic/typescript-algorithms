# Typed data structures

I use this repo to exercise in data structures and algorithms, based on [javascript-algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms) by [@trekhleb](https://github.com/trekhleb/).

## What is it?
It's me:

1. Picking a datastructure/algorithm from [javascript-algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms);
2. Rewriting it with strong typings in TS using TDD;
3. Copy-pasting general infro from readme and adding notes on usage.

## OMG, why?
Being a self-taught developer, I always felt the lack of knowledge of essential algorithms and data structures. I do this to fill in the gaps in my expertise and play around with TypeScript.

## What's there?
**Data structires:**

- [Linked List](/src/LinkedList/)

And so far that's it.

## Development

```sh
# lint
yarn lint

# build
yarn build

# test
yarn test
```

## Contributions
I am using this repo as a personal study and playground, no plans to turn this into anything serious. So if you want to contribute a typescript implementation of a data structure/algorithm — you're free to do a PR, but I might not merge it just because it is more interesting for me to build some things myself.

Pointing out errors and brainfarts, adding fixes and test is very much welcome.
